# Automated-Hilbert-Space-Mapping-for-Topological-Acoustic-Computing 🪇
This repository provides the required software to run the extraction_engine package for digital signal analysis for topological acoustics.
By implementing a modular "Extraction Engine" this package is able to automate the transformation of time-series acoustic data into high-dimensional Hilbert space vectors. This allows for the real-time mapping of state transitions—or "Phi-bits"—onto a Bloch Sphere representation, facilitating the rapid verification of non-linear logic gates. Built with a focus on reproducibility and data integrity, the repository integrates modern CI/CD principles to ensure that every experimental iteration is version-controlled, structured, and ready for advanced cryptographic research
